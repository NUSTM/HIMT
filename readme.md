# HIMT
The code for our paper Hierarchical Interactive Multimodal Transformer for Aspect-Based Multimodal Sentiment Analysis


# Usage
We use [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) to extract image features and corresponding semantic labels. You can download from [Baidu Netdist](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1F3rI0oSA2GTvToXlhXAsmQ) with code kbtf. Before you run the bash file, you need to change the parameter **--img_path** to your save path.
